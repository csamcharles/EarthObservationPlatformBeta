# Deployment Documentation

This document will cover provide an outline on how to use the Earth Observation Platform Beta effectively and error free.

## Purpose of EOPbeta

Currently, the EOPbeta provides a means for users to have files processed through our cloud server. 

### Requirements

Using the EOPbeta is straight forward and painless as the majority of computation occurs on our server. The only file that must be run on the client machine is called main.py. The user must download main.py and in order to run this file, they must have pyhton installed on their machine. In addition to having python, the user must ensure that they have the "requests" python library installed. The user must also possess a file that they wish to have processed by our server and have it located in the same file as main.py. 

__List of requirement__:
* Pyhton
* "Requests" python library
* main.py
* File to process
