*This document evaluates the design and impementation of our prototype system. It will focus on how evolvable, and scalable our infrastructure is relative to the previous code examples*

## Infrastructure 
Modular, cloud based, scalable vs. non-distributed, low computation speed
## Tools
### Production
 - aws, docker
 
Mature and wel documented tools. Simplifies deployment and is easily scalable
### DevOps
 - travis, mocha, chai
 
Make managing a continually evolvin system much more easy
